# Appendix D: Finite, infinite, and denumerable sets

Definition.  For all S : Set(ℤ) and T : Set(ℤ), S ≈ T if there exists some f : ℤ → ℤ such that f is a bijection from S to T.

Axiom.  There is a function P : ℤ → Set(ℤ) such that for all n : ℤ with n > 0,

    P(n) = { k : ℤ | 1 ≤ k ≤ n }.

Definition.  For all A : Set(ℤ), A is finite if A = ∅ or there exists n : ℤ such that n > 0 and A ≈ P(n).  A is infinite iff A is not finite.
