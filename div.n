Theorem 35.1 (Division).  Let a : ℤ.  Suppose that a > 1.  Then for any b : ℤ there exist q, r : ℤ such that b = qa + r and 0 ≤ r < a.

Proof.  Let B = { b : ℤ | b > 0 and there exist q, r : ℤ such that b = qa + r and 0 ≤ r < a }.  1 = 0 · a + 1, so 1 ∈ B.  Now let b ∈ B.  Thus there exist q, r : ℤ such that b = qa + r and 0 ≤ r < a.  Since r < a it follows from Axiom 34.7.1 that r + 1 ≤ a.

Suppose that r + 1 = a.  Then

    b + 1 = qa + (r + 1) = qa + a = (q + 1)a.

Thus b + 1 = (q + 1)a + 0 and 0 ≤ 0 < a.

Now suppose that r + 1 < a.  Then b + 1 = qa + (r + 1) and 0 ≤ r + 1 < a.

In either case b + 1 ∈ B.  We have shown that for all b ∈ B, b + 1 ∈ B.  So by [induction on ℤ] B = 𝒫.

Let b : ℤ.  If b = 0 then b = 0 · a + 0.  Now suppose that b < 0.  Then −b > 0.   Hence there exist q', r' : ℤ such that −b = q'a + r' and 0 ≤ r' < a.

Suppose that r' = 0.  Then −b = q'a.  Hence b = (−q')a.  So b = (−q')a + 0.

Now suppose that 0 < r'.  Then b = (−q')a + (−r') = (−q')a + (a − r') − a = (−q' − 1)a + (a − r').  Observe that a − r' < a since 0 < r'.  Also 0 < a − r' since r' < a.

Theorem 35.1.1 (Uniqueness of Division).  Let a, b : ℤ.  Suppose that a > 1.  Suppose that there exist q, r, q', r' : ℤ such that b = q · a + r = q' · a + r', and 0 ≤ r < a and 0 ≤ r' < a.  Then q = q' and r = r'.

Proof.  We know that (q − q')a = r' − r.

Suppose that r' = r.  Then r' − r = 0.  Hence (q − q')a = 0.  But a ≠ 0.  Hence q − q' = 0.  Therefore q = q'.

Now suppose that r ≠ r'.  Hence q − q' ≠ 0.  Therefore |q − q'| ≥ 1, so |(q − q')a| = |q − q'| · |a| ≥ |a| = a.  Thus |r' − r| ≥ a.  Now, r' < a and −r ≤ 0.  Hence r' − r < a.  Likewise, r < a and −r' ≤ 0.  Hence r − r' < a.  But either |r' − r| = r − r' or |r' − r| = r' − r.  So |r' − r| < a.  This is a contradiction.

Thus r' = r and q' = q.

Definition.  For all a, b : ℤ, a | b iff there exists c : ℤ such that b = ac.

Theorem 35.2.  Let a, b, c : ℤ.

    a. a | 0.
    b. 1 | a.
    c. a | a.
    d. If a | b and b | c then a | c.
    e. If c ≠ 0 and a | c then |a| ≤ |c|.
    f. If 0 | c then c = 0.
    g. a | b and b | a if and only if a = b or a = −b.
    h. a | a · b.
    i. If a | b and a | c then a | b + c.
    j. If a | b and a | c then a | b − c.
    k. If a | 1 then a = 1 or a = −1.

Proof.

    a. 0 = a · 0.

    b. a = 1 · a.

    c. a = a · 1.

    d. Suppose that a | b and b | c.  Then there are some d, e : ℤ such that b = ae and c = bd.  Then c = (ae)d = a(ed).  Hence a | c.

    e. Assume that a | c and c ≠ 0.  Then there is some d : ℤ such that c = ad.  Hence |c| = |a| · |d|.  Since c ≠ 0, d ≠ 0.  Therefore |d| ≥ 1.  Hence |c| = |a| · |d| ≥ |a|.

    f. Suppose that 0 | c.  Then there is some d : ℤ such that c = 0 · d = 0.

    g. Assume that a | b and b | a.  By (f), if a = 0 or b = 0 then a = b = 0.  Assume further that a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0.  By (e), |a| ≤ |b| and |b| ≤ |a|.  Hence |a| = |b|.  Therefore a = b or a = −b.

    h. Let c : ℤ = b.  Then a · b = a · c.

    i. Suppose that a | b and a | c.  Then there are some d, t : ℤ such that b = da and c = ta.  Then b + c = da + ta = (d + t)a.

    j. Suppose that a | b and a | c.  Then there are some d, t : ℤ such that b = da and c = ta.  Then b − c = da − ta = (d − t)a.

    k. Assume that a | 1.  By (e), |a| ≤ 1.  Hence |a| = 0 or |a| = 1.  But |a| ≠ 0 since 0 ∤ 1.  Hence |a| = 1.  Thus a = 1 or a = −1.

Definition (greatest common divisor).  Let a, b, d : ℤ.  d is a gcd of a and b if and only if d ≥ 0 and d | a and d | b and for all c : ℤ, if c | a and c | b then c | d.

Theorem 35.2.1.  Let a, b, d, d' : ℤ.

    a. Suppose that d is a gcd of a and b, and d' is a gcd of a and b.  Then d = d'.  [gcd is unique]
    b. 0 is the gcd of 0 and 0.
    c. If a ≠ 0, then the gcd of 0 and a is |a|.
    d. The gcd of 1 and a is 1.
    e. If a ≠ 0 or b ≠ 0 and d is the gcd of a and b, then 0 < d.

Proof.

    a. We know that d | d' and d' | d.  Hence by Theorem 35.2.g either d' = d or d' = −d.  Suppose that d' = −d.  Since 0 ≤ d, it follows that d' = −d ≤ 0.  But since 0 ≤ d', d' = 0.  Hence in all cases d' = d.

# Bézout's theorem

Theorem 35.3 (Bézout).  Let a, b : ℤ.  Suppose that a ≠ 0 or b ≠ 0.  Then there exist d, x, y : ℤ such that d is the gcd of a and b and d is positive and d = xa + yb.

Proof.  Let A = { z : ℤ | z = xa + yb for some x, y : ℤ }.  We will show that there is some z ∈ A such that z is positive.  Suppose that a ≠ 0.  If 0 < a then 1 · a + 0 · b = |a| > 0.  If a < 0 then (−1) · a + 0 · b = |a| > 0.  Now suppose that b ≠ 0.  If 0 < b then 0 · a + 1 · b = |b| > 0.  If b < 0 then 0 · a + (−1) · b = |b| > 0.  So in any case there is some z : ℤ such that z ∈ A and z is positive.

Let B = { x ∈ A | x is positive }.  By Axiom 34.7.2 there is some d : ℤ such that d is a least element of B.  Then d = x'a + y'b for some x', y' : ℤ.  Clearly for all c : ℤ, if c | a and c | b then c | (x'a + y'b).  Thus for all c : ℤ, if c | a and c | b then c | d.

We will now show that d | a and d | b.  By [Division] there are some q, r : ℤ such that a = qd + r and 0 ≤ r < d.  Hence a = q(x'a + y'b) + r.  Then r = (1 − qx')a + (−y')b.  Thus r ∈ A.  Since r < d and d is the least element of B, it cannot be that r is positive.  Therefore r = 0.  Thus a = qd, which implies that d | a.  d | b by a similar argument.  Thus d | a and d | b.

Definition.  Let a, b : ℤ.  a and b are relatively prime if for all c : ℤ with c > 0, if c | a and c | b then c = 1.

Lemma 35.3.1.  Let a, b : ℤ.  a and b are relatively prime if and only if the gcd of a and b is 1.

Proof.  Suppose that a and b are relatively prime.  Let c : ℤ, and suppose that c is the gcd of a and b.  Then c ≯ 1.  Now suppose that the gcd of a and b is 1.  Let c : ℤ.  If c | a and c | b and c > 0 then c | 1, so c = 1.
